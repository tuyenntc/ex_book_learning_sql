Select: Determines which columns to include in the queryâ€™s result set
From: Identifies the tables from which to draw data and how the tables should be joined 
Where: Filters out unwanted data
Group by: Used to group rows together by common column values
Having: Filters out unwanted groups
Order by: Sorts the rows of the final result set by one or more columns
